# PeerPrep - FocusTogether & GrowTogether.
Studying in a group improves understanding, retention, and critical thinking while keeping learners accountable and motivated.
But often,  many students struggle to find the right study partners, leading to ineffective learning, lack of motivation, and inefficient time management. Traditional study groups often face challenges like mismatched schedules and unstructured collaboration.
PeerPrep solves this by using AI to match students with compatible study buddies and providing study rooms, goal tracking, and mentorship, creating a structured and engaging learning environment.
